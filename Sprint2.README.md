## What is a Strategy in Design and Analysis of Algorithm?

In the context of Design and Analysis of Algorithm (DAA), a **strategy** refers to a general approach or method used to solve algorithmic problems. It is a high-level plan that guides the design of algorithms to efficiently solve a class of problems. Strategies help in breaking down complex problems, organizing solutions, and improving efficiency.

Common algorithmic strategies include:
- Divide and Conquer
- Greedy Method
- Dynamic Programming
- Backtracking
- Branch and Bound

## Divide and Conquer Strategy in Design and Analysis of Algorithm

**Divide and Conquer** is one of the most important and widely used algorithmic strategies. It involves breaking a problem into smaller subproblems, solving each subproblem independently, and then combining their solutions to solve the original problem.

### Steps in Divide and Conquer

1. **Divide:**  
   Split the original problem into two or more smaller subproblems of the same type.

2. **Conquer:**  
   Solve each subproblem recursively. If the subproblem is small enough, solve it directly (base case).

3. **Combine:**  
   Merge the solutions of the subproblems to get the solution to the original problem.

### Examples of Divide and Conquer Algorithms

- **Merge Sort**
- **Quick Sort**
- **Binary Search**
- **Strassenâ€™s Matrix Multiplication**
- **Closest Pair of Points Problem**

### Important Points about Divide and Conquer

- **Recursion:**  
  Divide and conquer algorithms are often implemented using recursion.

- **Efficiency:**  
  This strategy can significantly reduce the time complexity of problems compared to naive approaches.

- **Parallelism:**  
  Subproblems are independent, so they can often be solved in parallel.

- **Overhead:**  
  There may be extra overhead in dividing and combining steps, especially if the subproblems are not large enough.

- **Master Theorem:**  
  The time complexity of divide and conquer algorithms can often be analyzed using the Master Theorem.

- **Space Complexity:**  
  May require additional space for recursive calls and combining steps (e.g., in Merge Sort).

---

**Summary:**  
A strategy in DAA is a general approach to problem-solving. Divide and conquer is a powerful strategy that breaks problems into smaller parts, solves them independently, and combines their results. It is efficient, supports parallelism, and is the basis for many fundamental algorithms.

## What is a Recurrence Relation?

In the context of Design and Analysis of Algorithm (DAA), a **recurrence relation** is an equation or formula that defines a sequence of values, where each term is expressed as a function of its preceding terms. Recurrence relations are commonly used to describe the running time (time complexity) of recursive algorithms.

- **Purpose:**  
  Recurrence relations help us mathematically model and analyze the performance of recursive algorithms by expressing the total work done in terms of smaller subproblems.

- **Example Use:**  
  If an algorithm solves a problem of size `n` by recursively solving a smaller problem (like size `n-1`), the time taken can be described using a recurrence relation.

## Example: Recurrence Relation T(n) = T(n-1) + 1

This is a simple recurrence relation often seen in algorithms that reduce the problem size by 1 at each step (such as linear recursion).

- **Meaning:**  
  The time to solve a problem of size `n` (`T(n)`) is equal to the time to solve a problem of size `n-1` (`T(n-1)`) plus a constant amount of work (1 unit).

- **Typical Scenario:**  
  This relation appears in algorithms like:
  - Simple recursive functions that process one element at a time (e.g., finding the maximum element in an array recursively).
  - Linear search implemented recursively.

- **Solving the Recurrence:**
  - Expand the relation:
    - T(n) = T(n-1) + 1
    - T(n-1) = T(n-2) + 1
    - ...
    - T(1) = T(0) + 1
  - Substitute back:
    - T(n) = T(n-1) + 1
           = [T(n-2) + 1] + 1
           = T(n-2) + 2
           = ...
           = T(0) + n
  - If T(0) = c (some constant), then:
    - T(n) = c + n

- **Time Complexity:**  
  The solution is **O(n)**, meaning the algorithm takes linear time.

---

**Summary:**  
A recurrence relation expresses the running time of a recursive algorithm in terms of smaller inputs. The relation T(n) = T(n-1) + 1 describes algorithms that reduce the problem size by 1 at each step, leading to a linear time complexity O(n).

## What is a Strategy in Design and Analysis of Algorithm?

In the context of Design and Analysis of Algorithm (DAA), a **strategy** refers to a general approach or method used to solve algorithmic problems. It is a high-level plan that guides the design of algorithms to efficiently solve a class of problems. Strategies help in breaking down complex problems, organizing solutions, and improving efficiency.

Common algorithmic strategies include:
- Divide and Conquer
- Greedy Method
- Dynamic Programming
- Backtracking
- Branch and Bound

## Divide and Conquer Strategy in Design and Analysis of Algorithm

**Divide and Conquer** is one of the most important and widely used algorithmic strategies. It involves breaking a problem into smaller subproblems, solving each subproblem independently, and then combining their solutions to solve the original problem.

### Steps in Divide and Conquer

1. **Divide:**  
   Split the original problem into two or more smaller subproblems of the same type.

2. **Conquer:**  
   Solve each subproblem recursively. If the subproblem is small enough, solve it directly (base case).

3. **Combine:**  
   Merge the solutions of the subproblems to get the solution to the original problem.

### Examples of Divide and Conquer Algorithms

- **Merge Sort**
- **Quick Sort**
- **Binary Search**
- **Strassenâ€™s Matrix Multiplication**
- **Closest Pair of Points Problem**

### Important Points about Divide and Conquer

- **Recursion:**  
  Divide and conquer algorithms are often implemented using recursion.

- **Efficiency:**  
  This strategy can significantly reduce the time complexity of problems compared to naive approaches.

- **Parallelism:**  
  Subproblems are independent, so they can often be solved in parallel.

- **Overhead:**  
  There may be extra overhead in dividing and combining steps, especially if the subproblems are not large enough.

- **Master Theorem:**  
  The time complexity of divide and conquer algorithms can often be analyzed using the Master Theorem.

- **Space Complexity:**  
  May require additional space for recursive calls and combining steps (e.g., in Merge Sort).

**Summary:**  
A strategy in DAA is a general approach to problem-solving. Divide and conquer is a powerful strategy that breaks problems into smaller parts, solves them independently, and combines their results. It is efficient, supports parallelism, and is the basis for many fundamental algorithms.
